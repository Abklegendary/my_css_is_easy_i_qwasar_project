# Welcome to My Css Is Easy I
***

## Task
i am to create a html page withb a css style, and it is required to use flexbox
the page should be able to handle both desktop view and mobile view.
there will be 5 sections displayed and they will each have different colors assigned to them.

## Description
i created two directories index.html and style.css. i linked the css to the html
in the body of the html i have used div class because i have several number of codes.
the overall div class is the flex-container with 5 other div class under 6 other div class under it. the other class other it are header, hero, content sidebar and footer, the content and sidebar are both under a sub class under the flex-container. the sub class is called second-container.
for the css codes i used the @media to set the minimum width of the screen should be 640px, this means if there is a screen less than 640px it will change to mobile view
i added the flex-container inside the @media code blockand set the display to flex, flex-direction to column and then the justify-content to center, i did the same for second-container the only difference is the flex directionwhich is row.
i called flex-container and second container, inside their block code i added height and width and set them both to 100px
i called header and inside it block code i set the background color to blue, i did the same for hero and the color is red, and same for content and the color is green, and then side bar with the color purple, and lastly footer with the color grey. i then set all their flex grow to 1.
